## About Me

![Family](/assets/family.jpg)

My name is Jordan Berge. I am a husband to a wonderful wife and a father to an active, talkative little toddler and growing twin babies. I am also a life long student. I have always found analytics fascinating and have always wanted to learn how to leverage data to make better decisions. I have this blog to capture my study of data science and its many components. I first got interested in leveraging the power of data and statistics while studying my Economics degree at Brigham Young University. While studying Economics and Econometrics, I came to love the power and insight data can provide.

My goal with this blog is to provide a log of my learning and understanding as I grow and progress. I hope that my experience can provide insight and motivation to you. One of my favorite quotes captures the possibilities all of us have in learning comes from John Carmack:

*"In the information age, the barriers just aren't there. The barriers are self imposed. If you want to set off and go develop some grand new thing, you don't need millions of dollars of capitalization. You need enough pizza and Diet Coke to stick in your refrigerator, a cheap PC to work on, and the dedication to go through with it. We slept on floors. We waded across rivers."*

Quoted in David Kushner, Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture Chapter 16, p. 292.

Data Science is no different. There is a copious amount of resources on the internet that can help anyone learn about data science. This blog is an example of the material readily available and I hope I can show that anyone can put in the effort and time to become proficient in utilizing data to transform their business and life.

### About My Blog

My blog is running on Github using Jekyll. I am using the Centrarium theme created by Ben Centra. I made a few small modifications to colors and layouts. I am grateful for his nice simple theme and making it available for use.

The header image is a picture of a Kea Parrot taken by David Spiegel. Kea Parrots are a native bird of the mountains of New Zealand and are endangered. I choose this bird to be the header because they look amazing are known to be intelligent and curious.
