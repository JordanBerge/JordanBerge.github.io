JordanBerge.github.io is my personal blog which captures my thoughts and a log of my studies of data science, analytics and programming.

This blog is running on Jekyll and uses the Centrarium theme created by Ben Centra. I have made a few small modifications in regards to colors and layouts. Huge thanks to Mr. Centra for creating a nice clean theme and making it avalible to use.

The header image is an amazingly shot photo from David Spiegel, of a Kea Parrot.

If you have any questions or comments you can contact me by email at JordanBerge@gmail.com.

Thanks for taking the time to visit and read my blog.
